### **Time Complexity (TC)**:
- The code processes each node in both `l1` and `l2`, and the loop continues until both lists are fully traversed and any leftover carry is processed.
- The number of iterations is proportional to the length of the longer list, as both lists may not have the same number of nodes.
- Therefore, **TC = O(max(N1, N2))**, where `N1` is the number of nodes in `l1` and `N2` is the number of nodes in `l2`.

Your original notation `O(N1 + N2)` could be misinterpreted to imply separate, independent processing of the lists, which is not the case here. Itâ€™s better to use **O(max(N1, N2))** to reflect that the algorithm processes both lists together in a single traversal.

### **Space Complexity (SC)**:
- A new node is created for each digit in the result linked list, which will have at most `max(N1, N2) + 1` nodes (the `+1` accounts for a potential carry at the end).
- No additional data structures (e.g., arrays, stacks) are used, so the space is only for the output list.
- Thus, **SC = O(max(N1, N2))**, as the result linked list's size depends on the length of the longer input list.

Your analysis of **SC = O(max(N1, N2))** is correct.

### **Corrected Comment**:
```cpp
        // TC: O(max(N1, N2)), where N1 and N2 are the number of nodes in l1 and l2 respectively
        // SC: O(max(N1, N2)), as the size of the output list depends on the longer input list
```

This adjusted explanation better reflects the algorithm's behavior.
