### Method 2: Code Breakdown:
```cpp
// Base case: if the list is empty or has only one node, return the head.
if(head==NULL || head->next==NULL) 
    return head;
```
- If the list is empty (`head == NULL`) or contains only a single node (`head->next == NULL`), return the `head` as there's nothing to reverse.

---

```cpp
ListNode* newHead = reverseList(head->next);
```
- **Recursive call:** This line recursively calls the `reverseList` function with the next node (`head->next`).  
- It keeps going deeper into the recursion until it reaches the last node (base case), which will become the new head of the reversed list.

---

```cpp
ListNode* front = head->next;
front->next = head;
```
- **Reversing the link:** After recursion starts returning, this step reverses the link between the current node and its next node.  
- `front` is the next node (`head->next`).  
- `front->next = head` makes the next node (`front`) point back to the current node (`head`).

---

```cpp
head->next = NULL;
```
- **Breaking the link:** The original forward link needs to be broken, so `head->next` is set to `NULL`. This step is crucial to avoid cycles in the linked list.

---

```cpp
return newHead;
```
- Finally, the `newHead` (which was returned from the deepest recursive call) is returned as the head of the fully reversed list.

---

### **Example Walkthrough:**
**Input:** `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> NULL`  
- Start with `head = 1`  
- Recursive call on `head->next` (`2`)  
- Recursive call on `2->next` (`3`)  
- Base case hits with `3`, it returns itself (`3`).  

**Unwinding recursion:**
- `2->next->next = 2` → `3 -> 2`  
- `1->next->next = 1` → `3 -> 2 -> 1`  

**Final result:** `3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL`
